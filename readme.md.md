###So far so good, your are almost there , you might still need to do some work to finish this project , Do Stop , Keep learning with Udacity 💪💪💪💪💪


####Engineering Process and Quality
❏ All project code is stored in a GitHub repository and this link has been submitted
for review. There are at least two branches - one for development (dev,

development) and one master. Master should contain the most up-to-date, stable
code at the time of submission.
❏ Any variables use typescript typing wherever possible, variable and function
names are clear, endpoints are logically named. Good coding practices are
followed.

####Development Server
❏ Starting the server with npm run dev runs a local instance of the server with no
errors
❏ The stubbed @TODO1 endpoint in src/server.ts is completed and accepts
valid requests including:
http://localhost:{{PORT}}/filteredimage?image_url=https://timedotcom.files.wordpr
ess.com/2019/03/kitten-report.jpg
❏ Successful responses have a 200 code, at least one error code for caught errors
(i.e. 422)

####Elastic Beanstalk Deployment
❏ An endpoint URL for a running elastic beanstalk deployment (EB_URL) has been
submitted along with the project submission. This endpoint responds to valid
GET requests including:
http://{{EB_URL}}/filteredimage?image_url=https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.co

❏ The project was deployed using the AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI eb init, eb
create, and eb deploy commands.
A screenshot of the elastic beanstalk application dashboard is included in a
deployment_screenshot directory.
